Another soon-to-be-abandoned project, I'm sure. 

I've been working with computers professionally for almost 16 years, been a runner for almost 25 years, been a dad for almost 7 years, and I've realized I'm a lifelong learner. I realized recently that I spend way too much time consuming information without really thinking critically about it or doing much with it. This blog will provide me a space to reflect on what I'm doing with software, running, parenting, or just interesting ideas/books/articles/thoughts I come across. I had a wordpress blog about 10 years ago - at some point I'll get those posts in here for some laughs.
